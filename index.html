    <h1>GRIT</h1>
    <p>
      Grit. Each of us has it. As we engage challenge and adversity, as we break
      boundaries around what we may achieve, as we entertain even grittier
      instances of ourselves - our distinct brew of grit etches residuals into
      the canvas of our presence. Characteristics of grit:

      <tr>
        <td>
          Like a canvas that endures rough strokes, someone with grit maintains
          a solid foundation. They bounce back from setbacks, using adversity to
          strengthen their core.
        </td>
        <td>
          Gritty individuals wear their struggles proudly. Each "stain" is a
          testament to the hurdles they've overcome, and they see these marks as
          integral to their unique story.

          Grit comes with flexibility. The person can navigate through various
          challenges, adjusting their approach and mindset to match the demands
          of the situation.
        </td>
        <td>
          Grit involves a commitment to learning. Each experience, whether
          successful or not, contributes to the textured surface of the
          individual's canvas, making them richer and more nuanced.

      <tr>
        <td>
          Grit is about building endurance. The person doesn't crumble under
          pressure; instead, they accumulate layers of strength over time,
          allowing them to face increasingly challenging situations.
        </td>
        <td>
          Gritty individuals take an active role in shaping their destiny. They
          don't passively accept challenges; instead, they use bold and dynamic
          "brush strokes" to navigate and influence their journey.

      <tr>
        <td>
          Grit involves a continuous act of perseverance. The person assembles a
          mosaic of determination, piecing together their journey through the
          consistent choice to persevere despite difficulties.
        </td>
        <td>
          Gritty individuals are weathered by life's storms, but they don't
          succumb to wear and tear. Instead, they grow stronger with each
          challenge, embodying durability and steadfastness in the face of
          adversity.

    <h2>GRIT BY DESIGN</h2>
    <p>
      It is <em>grit</em> that led each of us to the debut
      <strong>Emergent Works Fall Intenive (2023)</strong>. It is the shared
      characteristic of grit that inspired the focus of this website. We
      appreciate you, and what our collective time together will gift to each of
      us as we advance beyond this cohort. See below for an overview of the
      process that produced this website.
